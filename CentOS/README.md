# Installing EScheme on your CentOS SCU Linux Machine

1. Download & run `escm-installer.sh` in your user home directory (the default location your ssh goes to). Note that you don't have to clone this repo either, you _only_ need `escm-installer.sh`.

2. Copy the output `alias='...'` statement to the end of your `~/.bashrc` file.

3. Run `. ~/.bashrc` at the command-line

4. Type `escm` anywhere in your terminal!
